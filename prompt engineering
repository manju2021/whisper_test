Data Collection: You start with raw audio data that’s transcribed into text (Whisper API), and then the speaker labels are added through diarization (Whisper Diarization API).
Data Structuring: You use a custom function to separate the transcription into customer and agent segments.
LLM Extraction: Using various types of prompts, you then extract structured data elements (text classification, entity extraction, sentiment analysis, etc.) from the conversation.
Prompt Engineering: This is the core of your methodology, where you design prompts to extract meaningful insights, ensuring that the model provides the right information in the correct format.

4. Best Practices for Prompt Engineering
To summarize and explain the methodology better:

Contextualization: Each prompt provides the LLM with necessary context, including examples and explanations of the task. This helps guide the model to give more accurate answers.

Clear Instruction: Prompts are explicit and direct, ensuring that the LLM knows exactly what it needs to do (e.g., classify sentiment, extract entities, provide solutions).

Structured Output: You ask the LLM to return answers in a structured format (e.g., "Yes/No", "Entity List", "Sentiment Classification"), which makes it easier to integrate the results into your analytics.

Examples: You provide clear examples of what the desired outputs should look like. This sets expectations for the model and helps it generalize better.

Iterative Refinement: Based on the results you get, you continuously refine your prompts to improve accuracy and relevance.

Summary of Prompt Engineering Methods in Your Approach:
Task-Specific Prompting: Tailored prompts for each data point you want to extract (e.g., sentiment, coverage).
Instructional Prompting: Clear instructions, context, and output structure are provided to ensure the LLM generates the correct format.
Few-Shot Prompting: Examples provided to guide the model’s predictions, ensuring better accuracy and understanding.
Contextual Prompting: You provide rich context to help the LLM understand the task, often supported by relevant examples.
Entity Recognition and Extraction: Focused on extracting named entities (e.g., personal information, products).
Role-Specific Prompting: Crafted to separate customer and agent dialogue, making the analysis more granular.

This would emphasize the structured nature of the tasks, the instructional approach to guiding the model, and the multi-task aspect (e.g., classification, extraction, sentiment analysis) of the approach.
